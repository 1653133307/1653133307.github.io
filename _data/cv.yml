    - Apart from research, I have enjoyed many different things at different stages of my life. In my early years I was passionate about drawing; during my teenage years I spent most of my time on sports, especially basketball; and in college I grew more into football. Nowadays I enjoy traveling and photography. I am also an avid FPS gamer â€” and firmly believe Overwatch is the best game in the world.
