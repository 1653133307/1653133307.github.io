I am a currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University, advised by [Edith Elkind](https://elkind.ee/edith). I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong.

My research interests lie in algorithmic game theory, with a particular focus on understanding **strategic behavior of agents across diverse environments**â€”ranging from **social choice problem**, **cooperative games** to **learning systems**, especially **large language models**.

I feel very fortunate to have been advised by [Alexander Lam](https://sites.google.com/view/alexanderlam/home) and [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/) during my time at CityU. In the final year of my undergraduate studies, I spent a year with [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/)'s group at the University of Chicago, where I benefited greatly from the generous guidance of [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) and [Fan Yao](https://www.yaofan29597.com/).
